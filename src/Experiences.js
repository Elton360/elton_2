    text: "As a front-end developer on Datto's second-largest product, I played a key role in collaborating with product owners, designers, and developers to translate and create dozens of UI-based user stories into seamless user experiences using React and Node. I proactively identified, investigated, and resolved numerous customer-facing issues, including high-priority bugs, in partnership with the QA team. My contributions were recognized with an elevation to code reviewer/approver, where I ensured high standards of code quality and maintainability across the project. I also focused on enhancing test coverage by crafting and integrating tests to ensure robust and reliable code. Additionally, I authored and updated technical documentation, which streamlined the onboarding process for new developers and captured complex solutions not previously documented. My efforts to address and resolve technical debt paved the way for seamless library upgrades, ensuring the productâ€™s technological relevance.",

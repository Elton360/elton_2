      "As a front-end developer on Datto's second-largest product, I played a key role in collaborating with product owners, designers, and developers to translate and create dozens of UI-based user stories into seamless user experiences using React and Node.

My contributions were recognized with an elevation to code reviewer/approver, where I ensured high standards of code quality and maintainability across the project.

Additionally, I authored and updated technical documentation, which streamlined the onboarding process for new developers and captured complex solutions not previously documented.
